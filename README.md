# TheLandingPage-TOP
This is for "The Landing Page" project from The Odin Project.

As stated above this is my attempt at "The Landing Page" project as part of The Odin Project. In this project I am to recreate the provided webpage design that they provided in the first image. The second image in the refImages folder shows colors, font types, and text sizes for me to reference.

Without looking at solutions from other students, my own knowledge and the use of google since researching is a key skill, I need to get my project as close as I can to the provided design.
